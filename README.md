# event-simulation

Discrete event simulation model to emulate a truck delivery system with the following properties:

 - 6 Trucks in the system
 - Trucks need to be loaded and weighed before delivery
 - There are two loaders and one weighing scales in the system
 - There is a loading and weighing queue for the loaders and scale, FIFO
 - Loading, Weighing and Delivery times are distributed in a probabilistic manner
